    <h1> Indicators</h1>

    <p> There are several goal 13 indicators that directly affect it and implements more countries in the world to put climate change laws in their rules such as signing agreements but in this page we will be looking at other goals in different Un SDGs that could help our goal.

          <h4> Introduction
 </h4>

 <p>As the Un progresses to the 13.2 goal to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. They are creating many agreements for these countries to sign and follow to limit and potentially end the threat of climate change. They are focussing on finding these 5 main indicators to understand how to approach them in the future. These 5 indicators are:

<br>
  -to implicit incentives for low-carbon energy in the electricity sector (measured as US$/MWh or US$ per ton avoided CO2) <br>
  -to find the rate of primary energy intensity improvement<br> 
  -to find the total energy and industry-related GHG emissions by gas and sector, expressed as production and demand-based emissions <br>
  -to find the availability and implementation of a transparent and detailed deep decarbonization strategy, consistent with the 2°C – or below – global carbon budget, and with GHG emission targets for 2020, 2030 and 2050 <br>
  -to find the Net GHG emissions in the Agriculture, Forest and other Land Use (AFOLU) sector <br>

          <h4> 52. Implicit incentives for low-carbon energy in the electricity sector (measured as US$/MWh or US$ per ton avoided CO2) </h4>

<p><b>The number 52 indicator </b> plans to implicit incentives for low-carbon energy in the electricity sector by reducing gas emmisions to a socially acceptible level. This will help the origonal goal to integare policies into National laws because it will require government policies to apply carbon prices using a range of measures, including but not limited to regulation, taxes, or carbon markets. This indicator will measure  the level of effective carbon price in the electricity sector and find a net cost for society. Though there is no one carbon price equivalent that can comprehensively capture what a diverse set of policies in a given country intend to achieve. This indicator is not favorable to the type of policies pursued by governments. It does not give preference to taxes, markets or regulatory instruments. In conclusion, the point of this indicator is to estimate the costs of lowering the greenhouse gasses and their impact on prices without comparing them to societal benefits.

          <h4> 53. Rate of primary energy intensity improvement
 </h4>

 <p><b>The number 53 indicator </b>also severely affects the goal 13.2's success. This indicator is to find the rate of primary energy intensity improvement. This indicator is used as the proxy for energy efficiency, which one of the pillars of the Sustainable Energy and the UN goal number 13 The indicator can be used to track the extent to which economic growth is decoupled from energy use.
Energy efficiency is measured by the ratio between the gross consumption of energy and gross domestic product . Typically, the energy consumption is reported across five major sources of energy: solid fuels/biomass, oil, gas, nuclear, and renewable resources. The indicator is expressed as the compound annual growth rate of energy intensity of GDP, measured in purchasing power parity terms. Though energy intensity is an imperfect  indicator because it is affected by external factors such as fluctuations in the volume and sectoral structure of GDP,there are statistical decomposition methods that the UN does that allow these types of effects to be stripped out. In conclusion, this indicator is used tof ind the energy aused and the pollution that is taken out from it by each country annually.

          <h4> 62. Total energy and industry-related GHG emissions by gas and sector, expressed as production and demand-based emissions (tCO2e)
 </h4>

<p><b>The number 62 goal indicator</b> also severely affects the goal 13.2's success. This indicator tracks total greenhouse gas  emissions in ton of CO2 equivalent , broken down by gas (including CO2, N2O, CH4, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6) and sector (including petroleum refining, electricity and heat production plus in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 guidelines for the national GHG inventory, and the special chapters on energy and industry-related emissions.The UNFCCC collects GHG emissions data, estimated using a production-based  accounting method. Under this approach, all emissions taking place “within national territory and offshore areas over which the country has jurisdiction”are assigned to a country.In other words GHG emissions for the importing country are augmented by the GHG content of the imports. Similarly, emissions for an exporting country are lowered. Demand or consumption-based emissions are estimated using international input- output tables and therefore require a more complex methodology. That is what this goal is about. </p>

          <h4> 77. Availability and implementation of a transparent and detailed deep decarbonization strategy, consistent with the 2°C – or below – global carbon budget, and with GHG emission targets for 2020, 2030 and 2050.
 </h4>
    <p>
     <b>The number 77 indicator </b>is really important for goal 13 and to measure its success. The indicator is to measure if we are keeping global warming within 2°C or less. This requires countries to prepare national deep decarbonization strategies to 2050. This should also cover all sources of GHG emissions including energy, industry, agriculture, forest, transport and more. These strategies should be directly shown and they should detail how countries intend to achieve cuts, how to reduce energy consumption, decarbonize the power sector, and electrify energy uses . They should include targets to reduce GHG emissions by 2020, 2030 and 2050. This indicator also proposes to measure the implementation of such a strategy. This indicator is used a lot and impacts the Paris Agreement which is the main agreement to follow the goal 13.2. To read more about the Paris Agreement click here:

    <h4>79. Net GHG emissions in the Agriculture, Forest and other Land Use (AFOLU) sector (tCO2e) </h4>

    <p><b>The number 79 indicator </b>is also really important to Goal 13.This indicator finds the total net greenhouse gas emissions – tons of CO2 equivalent in the Agriculture, Forest and other Land Use sector. They are broken down by gas  and by land used category (including forest lands, croplands, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other lands). 
This indicator wants to create inventory methods that need to be practical and operational. Emissions/removals of greenhouse gases do not need to be reported for unmanaged land. However, it is good practice for countries to quantify and track over time the area of unmanaged land so that consistency in area accounting is maintained as land-use change occurs. </p>
