<h2>About the Un Goal 13.2</h2>
<p> The goal 13.2 is the goal to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. The goal aims to mobilize $100 billion annually to address the needs of developing countries to both adapt to climate change and invest in low-carbon development. Supporting vulnerable regions will directly contribute not only to Goal 13 but also to the other SDGs that involve helping third world countries. This goal will strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries. It will also improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. 
  <br>
  <br>

On the Un website they state:
<br>
  <br>
"There is no country that is not experiencing the drastic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are more than 50 percent higher than in 1990. Global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system, which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not act.

The annual average economic losses from climate-related disasters are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. This is not to mention the human impact of geo-physical disasters, which are 91 percent climate-related, and which between 1998 and 2017 killed 1.3 million people, and left 4.4 billion injured. The goal aims to mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries to both adapt to climate change and invest in low-carbon development.

Supporting vulnerable regions will directly contribute not only to Goal 13 but also to the other SDGs. These actions must also go hand in hand with efforts to integrate disaster risk measures, sustainable natural resource management, and human security into national development strategies. It is still possible, with strong political will, increased investment, and using existing technology, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, aiming at 1.5Â°C, but this requires urgent and ambitious collective action."

<h2> My View on the Goal</h2>

<p>Ever since grade 4 when I first heard of climate change, it has always been my personal belief to resolve the problem of climate change by taking a stand and getting countries to develop new systems and ideas to prevent or even slow down global warming. Government research and development programs, such as the Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy, can drive progress in clean energy technologies and bring them to commercial use. Voluntary programs, like the Natural Gas STAR program, work with businesses to reduce emissions, often with public recognition. Though there is plenty more that the government is doing, it is not enough. The government has a lot of power and responsibility to solve these problems and climate change is one that is in dire need for a solution fast and the government is not doing enough. With the money and power they should have I think they should develop new and efficient strategies to emit less greenhouse gasses and be more eco friendly in a global standpoint. I have always advocated for this and was really happy when I heard about Greta Thunberg and I thought more people like me should try and be like her. I made a climate change club at my old school and try to teach others the effect and the causes of this problem and how we can stop it. That is also why I joined the sustainability council this year to give more of an effect in the local standpoint so that we could all chip in and fix this problem that we have caused. Even though I believe that every country should make new policies to help fix this problem, this website is designed for young adults all over the world because they are the next generation and this will be in their hands. Not only can they stop this in the future but also in the present as they can regulate their ways of life to be more sustainable and eco friendly because as I like to say every penny counts. I think this is a big problem because climate change can have impacts on human health and safety, the economy, natural resources, and ecosystems in Canada and throughout the world. Climate impacts put supply chains and billions of dollars of assets at risk. It is a global problem that requires a global solution. Climate affects nearly every aspect of our lives, from our food sources to our transport infrastructure, from what clothes we wear, to where we go on holiday. It has a huge effect on our livelihoods, our health, and our future. Climate is the long-term pattern of weather conditions in any particular place. If we pollute our world more and more then it will be disastrous for the earth and us and we have to fight to preserve our earth and our lifestyle.  </p>
